## Core Features:

- Space Creation: Create a 'space' for each project or client, acting as a container for content planning.
- Team Management: Invite team members using a unique 10-character token, limiting each space to a maximum of 3 members with equal permissions.
- Idea Capture: Capture raw content ideas in a dedicated section within each space, which can then be converted into scheduled posts.
- Post Scheduling: Plan posts with text, image/video references, and target platform, scheduling them for specific dates and times.
- Push Notifications: Receive push notifications on all devices when it's time to publish, with a direct link to copy the post content and update the status after manual posting.
- Post Status: Assign a status to each post (e.g., draft, ready to publish, published) for easy progress tracking.
- Activity Log: Implement a simple activity log for each post to track who created and last edited it, ensuring basic data governance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - A vibrant blue to convey trust and collaboration; hex: #3399FF
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 98%) - A very light blue to keep a bright space to enhance readability and minimize distractions; hex: #F2F8FF
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - A contrasting teal to bring attention to calls to action and important notifications; hex: #33A699
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a balance of modernity and readability.
- Use clean, modern icons for platforms and post actions. These should stand out without overpowering the text.
- A grid-based layout should be used in the calendar view and spaces for straightforward navigation.
- Incorporate smooth transitions when navigating between spaces and posts to reduce the perception of load times.
